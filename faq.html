                <h2>What are some safety tips for biking on the road?</h2>
            </li>
                <p> Some safety tips for biking on the road include:</p>
                <li>Wearing a helmet at all times.</li>
                <li>Following traffic laws and using hand signals when turning or stopping.</li>
                <li>Using lights and reflective gear when biking at night or in low visibility conditions.</li>
                <li>Being aware of and avoiding road hazards such as potholes or debris.</li>
                <li>Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles and being visible to drivers.</li>
                <li>Avoiding distractions such as listening to music or using your phone while biking.</li>     
            <li>
                <h2>What should I do if I get a flat tire while biking?</h2>
            </li>
                <li>Find a safe place to stop to change the tire.</li>
                <li>Remove the wheel with the flat tire by releasing the brakes and using the quick release lever or the 
                    axle nut to remove the wheel.</li>
                <li>Take out the inner tube and check for the cause of the flat.</li>
                <li>If the inner tube is repairable, patch the hole or replace the tube. If it's not repairable, 
                    replace the wheel completely.</li>
                <li>Reinstall the wheel and inflate the tire to the recommended pressure.</li>
                <li>Double check that the wheel is securely fastened before continuing your ride.</li>
                
                <p>It's always a good idea to carry a spare tube and tools to change a tire, since it's not always 
                possible to know when you will have a flat tire. Also it's good to know how to change a tire before it happens.</p>

                <h2>How can I stay visible while biking at night or in the rain?</h2>
            </li>
                <li>Use a white front light that's bright enough to be seen by drivers from a distance.</li> 
                <li>Wear reflective clothing and gear such as a vest or ankle bands.</li>
                <li>Make sure that your bike has reflective tape or decals on it.</li>
                <li>Avoid biking in the blind spot of vehicles, and use hand signals when turning or changing lanes.</li>
                <li>Try to ride in well lit busy roads or bike paths.</li>

                <h2>What should I do if a dog chases me while biking?</h2>
            </li>
                <li>Attempt to slowly and calmly ride away from the dog, keeping an eye on it but also checking 
                    for traffic and other hazards.</li>
                <li>If the dog continues to chase you, try to put a barrier between yourself and the dog such as a 
                    fence, a parked car, or a building.</li>
                <li>If the dog is aggressive, use your bike as a barrier, keeping it between you and the dog.</li>
                <li>Don't try to kick or hit the dog, as it could make the situation worse.</li>
                <li>If the situation becomes dangerous, seek help from a passerby or call animal control.</li>
                    
                <p> It's also important to remember that most dogs are friendly and just want to play, so it is 
                    important to be able to read the dog's body language and behavior to know if it has nefarious intentions.</p>

                <h2>How can I properly lock up my bike to prevent theft?</h2>
            </li>
                <li>Use a U-lock or chain lock that is difficult to cut or break.</li> 
                <li>Lock your bike to a secure, immovable object such as a bike rack or lamp post.</li>
                <li>Make sure to lock the frame of the bike, not just the wheel.</li>
                <li>Avoid leaving your bike in isolated or poorly lit areas.</li>
                <li>Take note of the bike's serial number in case it is stolen and recovered.</li>

                <p> Keep in mind that no lock is completely theft-proof, but by taking these precautions 
                    and investing in a high quality lock, you can greatly reduce the risk of your bike being stolen.
