# <Ride-or-Die>

## Description
This website is a resource for frequent travelers who love to explore cities on two wheels. The motivation behind creating this website came from a desire to support bikers traveling to new cities find shared biking resources. At the same time, we want to help them come prepared for the climate of their next destination to ride safely.  

## Challenges we faced include: 
- Finding a bike API that showed desired data
- Learning how to use Bulma as a design, especially the accordion for FAQ Page
- Figuring out how to utilize GitHub branches properly
- Figuring out that the bike API has limited data

## Successes we are proud of include: 
- Organizing the dates for the WeatherAPI
- Collaborating as a team to get everything done from brainstorm to finish
- Avoided merging issues (knock on wood!)

- SO THAT I can continue biking safely while traveling

## Acceptance Criteria:

## Future Development
For future iterations of this website, we would improve it by adding:
- Add weather icons and imagery
- Find a bike API that has more thorough database of bike sharing locations. Our current one is limited in the data it has. 
- Test out another css framework to add accorians to FAQ page
