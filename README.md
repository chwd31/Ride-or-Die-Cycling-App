# <Ride-or-Die>

## Description
This website is a resource for frequent travelers who love to explore cities on two wheels. The motivation behind creating this website came from a desire to support bikers traveling to new cities find shared biking resources. At the same time, we want to help them come prepared for the climate of their next destination to ride safely.
